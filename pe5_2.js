//CODE
// Step 1: Set the starting counter to 0
let counter = 0;
// Step 2: Create a variable, step, to increase your counter by
let step = 5; // You can change this step value to another number for different increments
// Step 3: Add a do while loop, printing the counter to the console and incrementing it by the step amount each loop
do {
    console.log(counter); // Output the current counter value
    counter += step; // Increment the counter by the step amount
} while (counter < 100); // Continue the loop until the counter is equal to or greater than 100
